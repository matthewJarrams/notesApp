Must Have

- Student information (id, name, parent info, belt, points, completed games, etc...)
- Notes

- Add, delete and update new students
- Add/delete notes

- Accounts for all staff

Cool to do
- Track/update points
- Track attendance
- List students who attended during the last session/day
- Track badge completion
- Give ratings to days to see performance? Give evaluations of knowledge?

How?

- MERN stack project?
- Use a DB to store information on a student and parent information and then wirte comments/notes about the student

- Base the app on the old notes app, but give it an update and provide some more functionality more specific to Marda Loop
- Use nicer CSS and other frameworks to make it look a little nicer
- Make the interface more freindly
